  review_1: If you've struggled to convert a format to ISO then you might find AnyToISO Converter offers a simple but effective solution.
  review_2: AnyToISO is a simple and easy-to-use tool for working with ISO files.
  review_3: "It offers a lot, such as the sort of user interface we love: just a clean, simple, and efficient. Using AnyToISO couldn't be easier."
  review_4: It just works. This app is essential for anyone who works with ISO images and dislikes using the terminal. For some bizzare reason Apple prefers not to let users create ISO images within the GUI.
  review_5: AnyToISO has been a mainstay for me for several years. It has handled whatever I have thrown at it, quietly, and without complaints. It is easy to forget that it is a product with developers who work hard to provide a good product. I know that there must be many people who are not aware of such a utility as the function is unique.

  faq-page: # https://www.crystalidea.com/anytoiso/faq
    title: AnyToISO FAQ
    q1_q: Audio CD Images support
    q1_a: Some programs have support for creating an image of Audio CD (NRG, BIN/CUE format or PDI format). These Audio CD images cannot be converted to ISO format due to the ISO format restrictions. NRG and BIN/CUE images can be extracted to individual WAV files using AnyToISO. Creation of ISO image from an AudioCD is impossible due to ISO format restrictions, use [BIN/CUE image instead](/anytoiso/create-iso-from-cd-dvd-mac-windows).
    q2_q: I click Convert but nothing happens!
    q2_a: Please be sure that the file you'd like to convert is exactly in one of the supported formats. It often happens that a file has a supported extension, although in reality it's of a totally different format (for example .bin - can be almost any file, while AnyToISO supports only BIN images created with software like Roxio Toast, NTI Dragon Burn, Roxio Easy Media Creator, Golden Hawk Technology CDRWin, Daemon Tools, IsoBuster, EZB Systems UltraISO, and some others.).
    q3_q: Do you provide a refund in some cases?
    q3_a: Yes. If the program does not work as advertised, please provide us with proof of this (a link, torrent, ftp link, e-mail, etc. to the image that you can not convert with PRO version of the program). If the file is one of [supported formats](/anytoiso/file-extract-convert-to-iso), the refund will be processed in full immediately.

    title: Macs Fan Control FAQ
    q1_q: What are optimal fan settings for my MacBook/iMac/..?
    q1_a: "The short answer is: experiment! First observe how temperature sensors behave under automatic fan control. Then try using some custom fan settings. Learn more about temperature sensors [here](/macs-fan-control/temperature-sensors)."
    q2_q: Why is Macs Fan Control reporting 0rpm for one of my fans?
    q2_a: It's ok if you have MacBook Pro 13 inch 2015/2016, these models turn off the fan when the CPU temperature is low enough. If you have another model, it most likely means that the fan did not report any data to MFC. It is possible that one of your fan's is dead (there's physical damage to the fan or its cable). Please check your computer with the Apple Hardware Test (it's on the DVD that comes with your computer) and see if it reports a failure with one of your fans.
    q3_q: The app asks for a password. Which password is that?
    q3_a: Macs Fan Control asks for the macOS administrator password when you decide to change fan control. It must be done only initially and when you install the update (when a new version of the app is released). Please don't ask us what YOUR computer's password is.
    q4_q: Does Macs Fan Control work in virtual machines (VirtualBox, Vmware, Parallels)?
    q4_a: No, MFC doesn't work in virtual machines and will never be able to do that. It's not technically possible.
    q5_q: Why isn't the app on the Mac App Store?
    q5_a: MFC uses low level access to mac hardware information. Though this method is publicly available (IOKit interface), this is not allowed on the Mac App Store.
    q6_q: How do I uninstall the app?
    q6_a: On macOS simply quit the app and drag it from the application folder to the trash. On Windows you need to run its uninstall program. [Uninstall Tool](/uninstall-tool) can be helpful here.
    q7_q: Why do I have high CPU usage by kernel_task when using Macs Fan Control?
    q7_a: Thermal issues are causing kernel task to preemptively use up CPU to prevent overheating. Try putting fan(s) back to auto and if it doesn't help, try to [reset the SMC](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295).

  title: SpeedyFox - Boost Firefox, Skype, Chrome, Thunderbird in a Single Click!
  description: Optimize performance of Firefox, Chrome, Skype, Opera, Chromium and many others 
  header: Boost Firefox, Skype, Chrome, Thunderbird in a Single Click!
  highlight_1: Boost Startup in up to 3 times!
  highlight_2: Speed-up browsing history
  highlight_3: Overall quicker operation
  highlight_4: Smaller profile size
  header_button_1: Download for Windows
  header_button_2: Download for macOS
  header_button_2_info: (supports only Firefox)
  stripe_1_header: Supported programs
  stripe_1_info_1: Mentioned programs start working much more slowly with the lapse of time. The reason is fragmentation of profile databases. SpeedyFox is specially designed to resolve this problem. The method used in SpeedyFox is 100% safe for your profile (e.g. bookmarks, passwords, etc), it's well documented and has been tested on millions of computers.
  stripe_2_header: How Speedyfox works
  stripe_2_info_1: With the passage of time SQLITE databases slow down considerably. It takes time to start apps that use such databases and the overall speed is affected. This is a very common problem and it occurs largely because of fragmentation of databases.
  stripe_2_info_2: SpeedyFox is able to fix this problem with a single click! It seems unbelievable but after you optimize your Firefox with this tool, you will get a fresh newly-installed feel because the speed indeed gets considerably faster. You will get up to 3 times faster startup speeds, browsing history will become faster, and performing operations with cookies will be quicker than before.
  stripe_2_info_3: SpeedyFox compacts those databases without losing any data. Databases are optimized to operate faster and are decreased in size.
  stripe_3_header: How to use Speedyfox
  stripe_3_info_1: Once installed, SpeedyFox automatically detects profiles of the supported apps. If you have more than one profile, you can select the one you want to optimize from the list. If you have a portable version of any of the supported app, choose your profile path manually by selecting 'Add custom profile...' profile from the context menu in the list. All you have to do is hit the 'Optimize' button.
  stripe_3_info_2: The optimization process can take from 5 seconds to a minute depending on how large your databases are. The whole optimization process is safe as it does not effect your history, bookmarks, passwords, etc.
  stripe_3_info_3: Depending on your browsing activity we recommend optimizing your profile once every 1-2 weeks.
  stripe_4_header: Command line usage
  stripe_4_info_1: optimize a certain profile (you can find its name in the SpeedyFox profiles tree)
  stripe_4_info_2: optimize custom profile of program_name located at profile_path (e.g. for portable versions of supported programs)
