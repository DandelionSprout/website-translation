Sad news for happy owners of Apple iMac Pro who would like to use Macs Fan Control on it - the app doesn't work correctly at the moment, it reports invalid fan readings for min/max/current fan values. This machine features the enormous dual-fan cooler, SMC reports 2 fans. 

Please do not try to change fan mode, leave it on Auto (controlled by the system). Temperature sensors readings are correct though.

It's the first mac model in more than 10 years when Apple changed [SMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Controller) specs (that has never been public actually).

We'll keep everyone informed on the progress in this [forum thread](https://forums.crystalidea.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=1976).
